# Lab Unit A1: Java and Eclipse

In this unit, we get familiar with Java and how we write simple Java programs in Eclipse.

## Scope of this Course

We have about two weeks to get you up to speed with Java. This is not enough time to cover everything. In addition to knowing most of the details, learning a programming language also requires experience. But the only we to become a good programmer (in any language), is to start using the language and start learning.

Within these two weeks, we will cover Java so that you understand the main features of it. It will be much easier to learn the language, and you will have enough overview so you can also find information on your own.


## Expected 

* Use the main features in Eclipse needed for Java programming
* Write, understand and run very simple Java programs


## Not Expected

* Deep knowledge of all language features
* Writing more complex programs on your own


## Other Sources to Learn Java

The internet, bookstores and libraries are filled with good learning material on Java. 

* The [original Java tutorials][oracle] cover all features of the language. 
* The book [Thinking in Java][tij] provides many explanations and exercises. You can [download] a free version of a previous edition.
* [Codingbat][codingbat] offers some nice coding exercises that you can directly solve on their web page.
