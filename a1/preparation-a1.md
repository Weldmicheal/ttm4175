# Preparation

Although you are going to work through the lab exercises in teams, 
you should each install the necessary software. 
When something goes wrong, you still have the other machine then. 


## Install Java
   
Install the Java Development Kit from **Oracle**. There are other development kits for Java, like OpenJDK or the ones from IBM, but to minimize room for errors we want that all use the same. So, we choose the one from Oracle. Also, since we will later use a special library that is not compatible with the latest version, we need **Java 8**. 

You can find instructions on how to install Java here:

## Install Eclipse

Eclipse is the development environment that we use to program in Java. Eclipse is itself a Java program, so you can only run it after you have installed Java.
